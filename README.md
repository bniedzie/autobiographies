Scripts used as part of Professor Whitney Arnold's Topic Modeling Research on Autobiographies

## convertTopicCSV.py
This script, written in Python 3.6, takes as input a loosely modified MALLET (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) topic file, as well as a spreadsheet of information about the documents used as MALLET input, each formatted as a .csv, and converts them to a .csv giving the per-year average weight for each topic.
